# TwitchEmoteAnalytics

This project is a proof of concept and a learning experience using AngularJS and Flask frameworks.

The purpose of this project is to create a website that users can view the most popular emotes on any twitch.tv channels (Summit1g, Timthetatman, and Imaqtpie). The web app would also allow users to view daily, weekly, and monthly analytics live for the channels. This project will be created using HTML, CSS, Angular JS and Twitter Bootstrap for the front end. Back end will be a Python web service using the Flask framework.

This project will be recording twitch chat in any number of channels.
- Python will be used to read and parse chat.
- Python will be used to create a RESTful API.
- AngularJS will be used for the front end application.
- Twitter Boostrap will be used for the front end design.


Possible Future Improvements:
- Include a database to store information
- Allow users to register and login to track more information
